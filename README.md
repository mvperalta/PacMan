</article>
<p> The PacMen Exercise is an exercise that was assigned in Module 7 of the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN bootcamp. The goal of this exercise was to create a pacman on the page. Javascript arrays generated the pacman once 'Add Pacman' is pressed. The pacman then moved across the page as it's mouth moved in a chomping formation. The second part of the exercise was to change the direction of the Pacman so that it moved across the page in the opposite direction. </p>
